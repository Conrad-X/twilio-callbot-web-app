**Twilio Calling Web App**
# Simplify call center operations and empower agents with an AI-driven web app built on Twilio. 
## Features
1) Automated Calling Workforce: Leverage AI bots to handle high-volume, repetitive calls, freeing up human agents for complex interactions. (Think appointment reminders, surveys, or lead qualification.)
2) Real-time Call Center Pulse: Monitor call progress, agent availability, and key metrics through a sleek, intuitive dashboard. Gain instant insights at a glance.
3) Seamless Agent Integration: Empower agents to effortlessly join calls, manage outcomes, and take detailed notes â€“ all within the web app. No more context switching!
4) Customizable Call Flows: Craft tailored call journeys that match your specific needs. Route calls to the right agents, automate tasks, and optimize agent workflows.
5) Actionable Analytics: Gain valuable insights into call performance, agent productivity, and customer interactions. Make data-driven decisions to continuously improve your call center.

# Tech Stack
*Front-end Framework: React for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
*JavaScript (with Twilio SDK): Enables real-time communication features and seamless integration with Twilio's API.
*Backend Server : Node.js to handle data processing, manage call logic, and interact with databases.
*Database : MariaDB for storing call records, agent data, and other relevant information.
*Cloud Communication Platform (Twilio): The backbone of your call center. Twilio provides the core functionality for making and receiving calls, managing communication infrastructure, and sending SMS. 





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
